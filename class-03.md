# Chapter 3: “Lists”

* *What are different types of lists in HTML?*

* *Lists are a made up set of items that are used to define termenology.*

**1) Ordered List:**

`<ol>` : this tag is used to create an ordered list that use numbers.

`<li>` this tag is used to define each item in the ordered list.

**2)Unordered List.**

`<ul>` this tag is used to create an unordered list that use bullets instead of numbers.

`<il>` this tag is also used to define each item in the unordered list.

# Chapter 13: “Boxes”
![image](https://user.oc-static.com/upload/2018/05/17/15265909024573_p1c5-1.png)

**1) Box Dimensions (width&hight):**

the hight and width properties are used in CSS to set the hight and width of HTML element. note: that in CSS the elements of HTML are treated like boxes. 


  **2) Limiting width (min-width,max-width)**

  the min-width and the max-width properties are used to to make the boxes adjust according to the user's screen. so if the user uses a narrow screen we assign the min-width. and if the user uses a large screen we assign the max-width.

  **3) Limiting Hight (min-height& max-height)**

  this technique is used to control the hieght of the boxes as they appear in the web page. if the content inside the box are too big to be contained inside the box it can result of an overlaping so for this we use the min-height and the max-height.

  **4) overflowing content**


if the content inside the box is the larger than the box itself we either use **(hidden)** to hide the extra content that is coming out of the box. or we can use **(scroll)** maked the box scrollable so the user can scroll up and down to see the whole content of the box.

**5) Border, Margin, & Padding**

* border refers to the edges of the box and separate it from other boxes.

* margin is set from the outside edges of the box's borders and we can use to create gabs between each element in the web page.

* padding is like the foam or space inside the box itself. and by pushing the padding we are changing the margin also. 

**6) White spaces & vertical margin**

white space is the space between items that is located inside the box. to control the text inside this box for example we want the text not the touch the edges of the box so style of the page would look better and not hard to read. so we use the white space to separate the content of the box from the box from its edges. useing margin and padding are very useful here.

**7) border width**

we used this technique to control the width of the edges of the box itself. for this property we use *(thin, medium, thick)*.

**8) Border Style**

 this techniqe is used to control and style the shape of the edges of the box.

 **9)Border color**
this techniqe is used to control and style the colors of the edges of the box.

**10) Change inline/block**

* **inline** when using is property we are changing a block-level to act like an inline bloch level. 

* **block** when using this property, we are changing an inline-block level to act like a block level. 

* **none** this property hides the element from the page completely.

* (the for loops); we use the for loop when we have to repeat a task a certain number of times. it consists of three parts (variable declaration and condition and statment) for exampel, ```for (variable;condition; change){statement}``` 

* ( the while loops); the while loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unkown number of times, untile a codition is met.  ```while(boolean-expression){statments}```

# Chapter 5: “Images” 

* **How to add images to pages**

  * create a folder called (images) that include all the images you want to use in your web page. this will keep thing orgnized. if your project is big enough you can subfolders to your images folder.  

  * `<img>` is used to add an image. this tag contains `src` which tell you the path of the iamge of your choise, `alt` which adds a describtion to the image if you can't see it, `title` which provides additional information to the image. 


* **choosing the right format**

   * height of the iamge specifies the heiht of the image in pixels. 

   * width of the image specifies the width of the image in pixels. 

   * three way to place an image;

           1) before a paragraph.

           2) inside the start of a paragraph. 

           3) in the middle of a paragraph.

   * Aligning images horizonally by using the attribute `<align>` which is an attribute that indicates how other parts of the page should flow around the image and it has two values (left&right) the left align the images to the left and the right align the images to the right>

  * Aligning images vertically and it has three values (top& middle& bottom). the *top* valuse places the first line of the text near the top edge of the image. the *middle* value places the the fisrt line of the text in the middle of the side edge of the image. and the *bottom* value places the first line of the text at the bottom of the images's edge. 



* **Rules for creating an image:**

       1) saving the image in the right format 

       2) save images at the right size.   

       3) use the correct resolution.  

* **Tools to edite and save images** 
   
   * using Adobe Photoshop.

   * using JPEG when having many different colors in an image. this fomate best used with images that contain natural scenes. 

    * using GIF or PNG when saving images with few colors and large areas. and it's best to be used with images that contain animations

 * **Image dimensions** 
     
     * the image you use on your website should be saved with the same height width that you wan them to appear in the web page. this can be achieved through; 

         1) reducing image size.

         2) increasing image size.

         3) changing the shape of the image. 

* **Cropping images**

    * before you crop any image you should bear in mind the shape of the image so you cannot lose any information of the page. each shape of an image (portrait, landscape) should be cropped correctly. 

* **Images Resolutions**    

   * images should be saved at a resolution of 72ppi. this is due to the compression that alot of videos and images have to compress the data contained in the video or image. so choosing the best compression is a mojor factor that determines the image's size.  

* **Transparency**
   
   * choosing Transparent GIF if the image has straight edges. 

   * choosing PNG ig the iamge have rounded edges.

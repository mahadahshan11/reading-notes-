# Forms and JS Events
 
 
 **Chapter 7: “Forms”**

 * In HTML forms refer to an element that allows the deeloper to collect information from users. an example for that would be the search box in any website. 

 * To ocntrole a form we have several of options;
 1) adding text.  2) making choices. 3) submitting forms. 4) uploading files. 

 * when the user makes choice or adding a text or any option control, the name of each control is sent to to the server along with its valuse, then the serever processes the input information given by the user through a programming laguage like Java, then the server creates anew page to send back to the user. 

 * the tags used in HTML to create a form are `<form>`. every form element require an action attribute that its value is already stored in the server. this action attribute have two methods (get or post). 

 * the tags used in HTML to create a form are `<input>`. this element is used to create different forms controls according to the type of the value. if the type attribute has a value of text, it creats a single line text input. when the type of attribute has a value of password, it creates a single line text input however, the characters inserted are blocked. if the type of attribute has a user select value which allows the user to pick just one option, we use `type='radio'`. if the type of attribute has a user select value that allows the user to select more than one option, we use `type="checkbox"`.  

* the tags used in HTML to create a form are `<textarea>`. this element is used to create multi-line text input.  

* the tags used in HTML to create a form are `<select>`. this tag is used to allow the user to select one option from a drop down list.

# Chapter 6: “Events”:

* Events are things that happen to HTML elements that allows JavaScript to react to these events. the things that could happen to HTML elements could be something the browser dose like (a wab page that finished loaidng), or it could the things that the user do like( a user clikcing a buttom). the Javascript role begin when some thses events are detected. the HTML allows an attribute to be linked to its elements so it can handled by Javascript. `<element event='some JavaScript'>` . 

* we the Javascript deticte events in HTML elements, it decided alot of things, like which of the things that should be done every time the page loaded. or what should be done when the page closes. what is to be performed when a buttun is clicked. then the HTML attributes allow Javascript to exute the code directly or call functions.

* In the late 2014 google startd a new project called 'Aristotale project' to study the norms of what make the perfect team. after collecting data for three years with, the results  contradicted eachother and the researchea could not point out excatly what makes a team the very successfull and very productive. 

* the results show that the success of the particular team goes beyond its memebers and thier IQ and their qualifications. that even teams with a highly experienced and professional memebers fail and are not productive. so having smart people in team does not guarantee its success. 

* normas are the unspoken rules between the team memebers, these rules and norms were the subject of the study that the researches were focuing on. and they started to study what are the norms that the perfect team share. 

* At the end of the three years study conduct, the project Aristotal reached two major result. or two norms that was somehow persistent in all the successful and productive teams. these results are: 

           1) All members of team speaks an equall proprtion of time. meaning than there is no one person in the team who speak all the time but rather the whole team takes turns in talking and expressing thier ideas equally.

           2) the second and most important element found in the Arestotale project is having an emotionall intellegance or social intuition among the team memebers. meaning that it is very a mojor contribution to the team's overall success if all the its team memerbers are able to translate social cues and act accordenly.   

 * This  social sensitivity is what later in the project was defined as the **psychological safety**. which is when the individual are in an environment where he/she are complitetly comfortable to express her/his ideas and talk about his/her emotiones openly with the fear of being judged or criticize. having this norm of psychological safty in team makes it much more productive and much more fun and it almost guarantee the team's success.

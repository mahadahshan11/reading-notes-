growth mindist is a very important concept to grow and expand as an ambitious individual.


to put it in Shakespeare's own words:


***To Be or not To Be***


To grow as person first and as developer second, one's must have an open mindest. the open mindest view the individual progress as a result of perseverance and constant effort, not just a product of god-given talents and intrlligence. 

open mindest allows the individual to embrace criticism and feedback that is integral part of growth and view it as an invitation to imporve one's skills. it also views problems as challenges rather than obstacles

in conlusion, open mindest allows the person to grow inside and out side the work.

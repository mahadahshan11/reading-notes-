* There are two kinds of text editors; first are the text editors we use to write and edite texts without coding.
the second type, which is our main concern here, are the text editors we use to write and edit codes and help us build our websites.

* These softwares have several features to help the developer such as, the code completion, which helps to finish and complete the code for you.and Emmet is another feature, which is a shorthand language that help the developer to speed up the coding, and syntax highlighting that enable the developer to colore his/her text inorder make it noticeable. 


* Every developer must use the text editor that comes with his/her own computer type. for example Mac use "Text Edit" and Windows use "Notepad".
developers are advised to download other text editors because the ones installed on your own computer don't have helping features. 

* Before downloading any text editor, the developer must be aware of never to use any bold, italic, or underlined features while coding. and to create a file to store his/her website in with the appropriate extension. 

* the developer must decide whether to use a Text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
the fist only edit texts, however, the later have many other options like calendar, to-do list and so on. 

* command line is a window inside the developer that allows the developer to control the computer from the inside.it manages the files on the computer and control their paths, navigation. it can also remove files and change the names of files through a text which the developer types with the desired commands.

* the command line itself is contained of six lines.

    * line 1 present the prompt, next we enter our command. 

    * line 2-5 present the output of the command we just entered. 

    * line 6 present the prompt again to close the command and start a new one. 

* These commands are typed inside the terminal right after what's called "the bash".

* To navigate inside the terminal the developer will use shortcuts like pwd,  Is, cd, and so on.

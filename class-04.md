*the new HTML layout elements helps describe the structure of the page and also help developers to ignore the header and the footer and go stright to the content. 

1- The header and the footer `<header> <footer>`; the header contains the site name and the main `<nav>` bar while the footer contains copy rights information and links to social media websites. 

2- The navigation `<nav>`; used to represent a section that contain nevigation links either withing the current document or other document.

3- Articles `<article>`; represent an independent unite of content which means the information contained in the article can be distributed independently from the rest of the site or it appears in. 

4- section `<section>`; it is an element that used to group together ralated elements.

5- Asides `<aside>`; the aside element have two different purposes depending whether it was placed inside or outside of `<article>`. if it was placed inside an article then it contian information that related to article. however, if it was placed outside the article then it acts like a container that is related to the rest of the web page. 

5- Heading groups `<hgroup>`; the purpose of the `<hgroup>` is to gather a set of one or more `<h1>`and treated as one single heading.

Fuctions are used when we have a certain block of code that is repeated multiple times through our whole code in different locations. for example, having 10 for loops in your code. so fuction is a collection of statments that are grouped togather in order to simplify your code. 

* *Classes & Objects:*

in java script we learned about many types of data like string which is a series of characters or a number data type or a boolean data type which holds the valuse of true or false. however, some times we have a certain type of data that cannot be defained. in orderd to represent these undefainable data is by using  a class. the class allow us to model a real world attribute inside your programe. so essantaily class enable us to create our own custom data type  and this custom-made data represnt a real world entity. so if I want to defain a student. first I have to give him certain attributes like firstName, lastName, age, gpa. this is the process of defaining a student in general. however, when I want to defaine a certain individual student. we use objects. objects are when we give the studen's values according to the attributes that are assigned in the class. for example the vakuse of the firstName attribute assigned in the class would be 'maha'. the lastName would be 'dshshan'. the age attribute would be '22' and so on.

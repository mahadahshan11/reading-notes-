*To understand the concept of the variable imagine this senario. for example in a shoping website the products are displayed in a list and each product has its own price.when the store offer a discount the price would be updated in every page of the website where the product appears according to right caculation written inside the variables*.


```//list of products```

```"sneaker price: 40$"```

```//sneaker detail page```

```"sneaker price: 40$```

```//combi products```

```"sneaker price:40$ product-B price: 20$"```


**RULES FOR NAMEING A VARIABLE:**

1- The must start with a name or ($) or (_). NOT A NUMBER.

2- No keywords or reserved words.

3- Should not use same variable name with different cases.

4- The name should describes the type of information stored inside the variable.

5- Since the name of the variable should not cntain any spaces, each word should start with capital letter. for example, *fistName*.

**DATA TYPES: ARRAY**

It is a type of variable the displayes the same kind of data. for example, a list of friends on Facebook. other programming languages have thier own dtatype for an ARRAY. however, in Javascript we mix different types of data inside the ARRAY.

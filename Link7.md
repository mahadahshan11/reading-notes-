*Comparison operators evaluating conditions*

* ```==``` checkes if the value of the two values are equal or not. for example, ```(A==B)``` is not true.

* ```!=``` checkes if the one value is not equal to the other value. for example, ```(A!=B)``` is true.

* ```===``` check if the datatype in both ends and the valuse are the same and equal. for example, ```'A'==='A'``` is true.

* ```!==``` checkes if the datatypes at both ends and valuess are not the same. for example, ```'A'!== A``` is true.

* ```>``` checkes it a number is greater than the other. for example, ```2 > 1``` is true.

* ```<``` checkes if the a number is lesser than the other. for example, ```3<4``` is true.
* ```>=``` checks if the number is greater than or equal than the other. for example, ```4>=3``` or ```4>=4``` is true.
* ```<=``` checkes if one number is lesser than or equal to the other number, for example, ```4<=5``` or ```4<=4``` is true.

# **Logical Operatores:**

*A logical operator help you understand the result value of two operants. for example,*

 *  **&& (logical and );** called Logical AND. if both the operands are non-zero the the condition become true.
 * **||(logical or);**  called Logical OR operator. if the any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition become true. 
* **! (logical not);** called Logical NOT operator. used to revered the logical state of its operand. it the condition is true then logical NOT operator will marke false. 



```boolean b1 = true && true; // true```

```boolean b2 = b1 && flase && true; // false```

```boolean b3 = b2 || true; // false``` 

```boolean b4 = !b2; // true```

```boolean b5 = !(b4 && b2); // true```

# Loops
*loops allow us to continue to execute a certain function multiple times*

**Types of loops**

* (the for loops); we use the for loop when we have to repeat a task a certain number of times. it consists of three parts (variable declaration and condition and statment) for exampel, ```for (variable;condition; change){statement}``` 

* ( the while loops); the while loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unkown number of times, untile a codition is met.  ```while(boolean-expression){statments}```
